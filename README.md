The API Platform Admin-On-Rest POC
==================================

This project is based on [Admin-On-Rest][1] and [Api-Platform Workshop Edition][4] and is a POC how to make [Api-Platform][5] and [Admin-On-Rest][1] working together.

Clone this project and run 

    npm install
   
If you want to change the default entrypoint (`http://localhost`) you have to do it in the `restClient.js` file.
   
Then run 

    npm start

Enjoy !
